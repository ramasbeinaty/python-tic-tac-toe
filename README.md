## Not your ordinary tic-tac-toe game
Popularly, a cmd tic-tac-toe is coded using a 2D array and hence, requests the player to enter the row and column of where he wishes to play.

This is different. The game board is stored instead in a 1D array and only 1 value is requested from the player, the cell number displayed. 

## Future Features
- Play against a computer
- Play against a smart computer
- Include multiple rounds in one game and a scoreboard
- End game if outcome is known to be a tie (maybe)
