## Not your ordinary tic-tac-toe game
Popularly, a cmd tic-tac-toe is coded using a 2D array and hence, requests the user to enter the row and column of where he wishes to play.

This is different. The game board is stored instead in a 1D array and only 1 value is requested from the user, the cell number displayed. 

## Future Features
